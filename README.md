# My personal dotfiles

## shell

Configuration files for zsh and bash are available.

Easiest way to implement:

```shell
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:haukurh/.dotfiles.git
# bash
mv .bashrc .bashrc.bak && ln -s .dotfiles/.bashrc .
# zsh
mv .zshrc .zshrc.bak && ln -s .dotfiles/.zshrc .
```

## git config

Some useful git configuration can be included in `~/.gitconfig`

```ini
[user]
	name = <YOUR NAME>
	email = <YOUR EMAIL>
[include]
	path = ~/.dotfiles/gitconfig
[includeIf "gitdir:~/src/work/"]
	path = ~/.gitconfig-work
[includeIf "gitdir:~/src/projects/"]
	path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
```

With these includeIf statements we can have custom settings based on folders,
this can be useful if you use have different git email for work vs. personal for example.

## macOS terminal

iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh are boring...

Why not simply configure terminal to pretty and familiar?

You can import the Terminal.terminal profile into the macOS terminal
